# F-actin_model
This repository contains files for F-actin model in beta cell

This project is building beta-cell model including F-actin network and
modeling interactions between insulin granules and F-actins. The cell
model is generated and sampled using Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP).

IMP version: 2.11.0 stable release

written by: Huaiqing Cao, Sali lab, Shanghaitech University.

This project now contains two individual models: the interaction model
between single granule and F-actin, and the cell model containing multiple
granles and F-actins.

The interaction model is generated to model the association/dissociation
process of granule and F-actin. New interaction model can be generated by
running: 
python3 scripts/actin_granule_binding/granule_actin_interaction.py

The cell model contains multiple F-actins aiming to construct F-actin
networks. New cell model can be generated by running:
python3 scripts/actin_granule_binding/multiple_filament_model.py

Currently this script is not able to generate crosslinked F-actin network. 
It can only model the interactions between individual F-actins which are
in Brownian motion.
